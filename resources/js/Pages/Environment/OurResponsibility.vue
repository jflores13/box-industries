              At Box Industries, we're taking concrete steps to reduce our environmental footprint. Our ongoing efforts include the reuse and recycling of plastic and corrugated pallets, minimizing waste across our logistics processes. As we expand, we're preparing a dedicated area within our facility for recycling used cardboard — moving toward a more circular packaging model.

              We believe packaging should do more than protect — it should protect responsibly. That's why we prioritize materials that are recyclable, reusable, and sourced responsibly. Our recycled pallet program is already active, and future developments will expand into cardboard recovery and repurposing — turning old packaging into new opportunities.
