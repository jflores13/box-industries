    long_description: 'We rely on advanced CAD tools to develop packaging solutions that meet functional, structural, and logistical needs. From the first sketch to the final model, our design process ensures efficiency, precision, and adaptability. CAD design allows us to collaborate across disciplines, detect potential issues early, and simulate packaging performance before moving into production.'

    long_description: 'We use digital simulations to evaluate the strength, durability, and behavior of our packaging solutions under real-world conditions. This includes load-bearing analysis, impact behavior, and structural response to handling and transportation. These early insights help us fine-tune designs, reduce material waste, and deliver smarter, more efficient packaging.'
