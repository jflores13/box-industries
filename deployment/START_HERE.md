## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Prepare Locally (5 minutes)
```bash
# In your local project directory
npm run build
php deployment/scripts/export-database.php
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Setup on Server (10 minutes)
```bash
# Connect via SSH
ssh username@yourdomain.com

# Clone your repo
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/box-industries.git
cd box-industries

# Configure
cp deployment/env.production.template .env
nano .env  # Edit database credentials

# Install & setup
composer install --no-dev
php artisan key:generate
chmod -R 775 storage bootstrap/cache
php artisan optimize
```

### Step 3: Configure cPanel (5 minutes)
1. **Create database** (MySQL Databases)
2. **Import database** (via SSH or phpMyAdmin)
3. **Point domain** to `/home/username/box-industries/public`
4. **Setup cron job** for Laravel scheduler
5. **Enable SSL** (AutoSSL)

**Done!** 🎉

## 🔄 Future Updates

After initial setup, updates are ONE command:

```bash
ssh username@yourdomain.com
cd ~/box-industries
bash deployment/scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script automatically:
- ✅ Enables maintenance mode
- ✅ Pulls latest code
- ✅ Installs dependencies
- ✅ Runs migrations
- ✅ Clears & rebuilds cache
- ✅ Disables maintenance mode

## 📖 Recommended Reading Order

1. **Right now:** `SSH_CHEATSHEET.md` (2 minutes)
2. **Before deploying:** `SSH_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` (10 minutes)
3. **Keep handy:** `QUICK_REFERENCE.md` (during deployment)
4. **Reference:** `README.md` (when you need it)

## 🔧 What You Need From Your Hosting Provider

Make sure you have:

- [x] SSH username and password
- [x] SSH hostname (e.g., `yourdomain.com` or IP address)
- [ ] Confirm PHP version is 8.2+ 
- [ ] Confirm Composer is available
- [ ] Confirm Git is available

**Test SSH access:**
```bash
ssh username@yourdomain.com
```

If that works, you're golden! ✨
